          Hi, I'm Faith, i’m a frontend developer from Abuja, Nigeria. I've
          always been captivated by the art of bringing stunning web designs to
          life as actual websites and this fascination led me to frontend
          development.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2022, I started teaching myself to code. Although I had tried,
          unsuccessfully, to learn in 2020, I found renewed enthusiasm when I
          picked it up again. I learnt from anywhere I could, Twitter, youtube,
          articles, websites books, Udemy, among others, and so far, I have
          fallen in love with coding, I love learning and applying my knowledge
          and seeing the result, it’s a very rewarding cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a degree in computer science, I have a solid foundation in
          computer basics and acquired skills that I brings to my work. I am
          always open to new challenges and opportunities to learn, grow and
          expand my skillset.
